1.Objective-The task of JSON-fixing involves providing a model with an invalid JSON string that contains errors or formatting issues, and having the model return a corrected version that is syntactically valid according to JSON standards. The goal of this task is to evaluate how well the model can identify and repair errors in JSON formatting, ensuring the corrected JSON maintains the original structure and data as closely as possible while adhering to proper syntax rules.

2.How you created your benchmark test and the rationale behind the design-

1.1)Dataset Collection:Used small sample data which consist of valid json and malformed json.for the test I have used small dataset as there was no specific requirement for the data was mentioned.

1.2)Error Injection:

  a)Error Types: Introduce common JSON errors into the valid JSON samples. These errors can include:
  b)Syntax Errors: Missing commas, incorrect brackets, or unmatched quotation marks.
  c)Structural Errors: Incomplete objects, arrays, or mixed types.
  d)Data Type Errors: Incorrect usage of numbers, strings, booleans, or nulls.

1.3)Benchmark Creation:

  a)Evaluation Criteria: Define clear metrics for evaluating the model's performance. These could include:
  b)Accuracy: Percentage of JSON samples that the model correctly fixes.
  c)Error Type Resolution: Percentage of specific error types that the model can fix.
  d)Structural Integrity: Whether the corrected JSON maintains the logical structure of the original input.
  e)Output Validity: If the corrected output is a syntactically valid JSON.

1.4)Automated Evaluation:

  a)Validation Scripts: Develop scripts to automatically validate the output of the model against expected results. These scripts would check if the output is valid JSON and if it matches the intended correction.

4.Your analysis and reflections, including any data visualisations, and insights derived from this exercise

  a)Focus on Complex Errors: If the model struggles more with complex, nested JSON structures or with multiple errors, it may benefit from more training data featuring such complexities or from architectural improvements.
  b)Need for Diverse Training Data: The model’s generalization capabilities can be enhanced by exposing it to a wider variety of JSON formats and error types during training.
  c)Improve Error Detection: Cases where the model introduces new errors indicate a need to improve its error detection and correction algorithms. This could involve refining rules or incorporating more sophisticated logic.
  d)Optimize Performance: Understanding the distribution of execution times can help optimize the model’s performance, making it more suitable for real-time applications.

5.Instructions to run your code so we can reproduce these tests
  a)I have added code in code.py file in the same code repository just add the Deepinfra API key and run the code.py file as I have added sample data in code itself it will reproduce the result.

Enhancements-

1.The large data can be used for validation for the scope of this assignment only few test cases are used.
2.The default values of hyperparameter for each models are used but can use and test with multiple hyperparameter.
